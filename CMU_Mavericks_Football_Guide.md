# 🏈 The Freshman’s Quest Guide to CMU Mavericks Football

Welcome, traveler. If you’re new to football and the Colorado Mesa University Mavericks, think of this as your quest log: a guide to history, rules, roles, champions, and rituals.

## 📜 1. Origins of the Quest
Football began in the late 1800s as a fusion of rugby and soccer. Over time it evolved: helmets were added, the forward pass was born, and strategy deepened into the tactical saga we see today.

---

## 🗺️ 2. Rules & Strategy
- **The Battlefield**: 100 yards long, 53 yards wide, with endzones and tall goalposts.  
- **The Mission**: Move the ball 10 yards in 4 tries (downs). Success resets your count.  
- **Scoring**:  
  - Touchdown (6 pts): Carry or catch the ball in the endzone.  
  - PAT (1–2 pts): A quick follow-up strike.  (Could be a field goal after a touchdown for 1 pt (most common) or go for the "extra" point and throw it to a receiver for 2 pts)
  - Field Goal (3 pts): Kick through the uprights.  
  - Safety (2 pts): Trap the foe in their own endzone.  

**Strategy Vectors**  
- **Ground Attack**: Running plays = steady advances.  
- **Air Raid**: Passing plays = bold, high-risk moves.  
- Balanced teams blend both for maximum effect.
